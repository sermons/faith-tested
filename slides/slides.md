# Faith that <br/> Stands the Test
## James 1:2-12

<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
# What does it mean to have **faith** in Jesus?

---
## James 1:2-4 (NIV) (p.1/5)
<span class="hl2">2</span>
Consider it **pure joy**, my brothers and sisters, <br/>
whenever you face **trials** of many kinds, <br/>
<span class="hl2">3</span>
because you know that the <br/>
**testing** of your faith produces **perseverance**.

<span class="hl2">4</span>
Let perseverance **finish** its work <br/>
so that you may be **mature** and **complete**, <br/>
not **lacking** anything.

---
## James 1:5-6 (NIV) (p.2/5)
<span class="hl2">5</span>
If any of you lacks **wisdom**, <br/>
you should **ask God**, who gives **generously** <br/>
to all without finding fault, <br/>
and it will be **given** to you.

<span class="hl2">6</span>
But when you ask, <br/>
you must **believe** and not doubt,

---
## James 1:6-8 (NIV) (p.3/5)
because the one who **doubts** <br/>
is like a **wave** of the sea, <br/>
**blown** and **tossed** by the wind.

<span class="hl2">7</span>
That person should not expect <br/>
to receive anything from the Lord. <br/>
<span class="hl2">8</span>
Such a person is **double-minded** <br/>
and **unstable** in all they do.

---
## James 1:9-10 (NIV) (p.4/5)
<span class="hl2">9</span>
Believers in **humble** circumstances <br/>
ought to take **pride** in their **high** position.

<span class="hl2">10</span>
But the **rich** should take pride <br/>
in their **humiliation** —  <br/>
since they will pass away like a **wild flower**.

<span class="hl2">11</span>
For the sun rises with **scorching heat** <br/>
and **withers** the plant; <br/>
its **blossom** falls and its **beauty** is destroyed.

---
## James 1:11-12 (NIV) (p.5/5)
In the same way, the rich will **fade away** <br/>
even while they go about their **business**.

<span class="hl2">12</span>
Blessed is the one who **perseveres under trial** <br/>
because, having stood the test,

that person will receive the **crown of life** <br/>
that the Lord has **promised** <br/>
to those who **love him**.

## James 1:1 (NIV)
To the **twelve tribes** scattered among the **nations**

>>>
+ *scattered* (τῇ  Διασπορᾷ):
+ immediately after Stephen's stoning (Ac7)

---
## Acts 8:1 (NIV)
On that day a **great persecution** broke out <br/>
against the **church** in Jerusalem,

and all except the apostles <br/>
were **scattered** throughout Judea and Samaria.

Those who had been scattered <br/>
**preached the word** wherever they went.

>>>
+ **Saul** going door-to-door
  + prison, forfeiture, threat to family
+ But God used to spread **gospel**
+ trials: threat to **std of living**
  + **accustomed**: my life, school, work, time

---
whenever you *face* **trials** of **many kinds**

>>>
+ *face*: fall around: **encounter**
  + **innocently**: robbers, ship + rock
  + not due to own **sin**
  + not that we **pursue**
+ *trials* (πειρασμοῖς): **test**, tempt
  + v13: not **from** God, but allowed
+ *many kinds*: diverse sort

---
**Consider** it pure **joy**

>>>
+ *consider*: deem, lead: **assess** + **decide**
+ *pure*: **all**: of the trial
+ *joy*: Gr: inner happiness, pleasure
  + NT: **grace**, fruit of HS
  + from **trust** in God's **goodness**

---
the **testing** of your faith produces **perseverance**.

>>>
+ *testing* (δοκίμιον): not same as trial/tempt
  + **proof**, reliable, esteemed Ro5:3-5
+ *perseverance*: **remain** under
+ &rArr; **mature** + complete

---
## 1 Peter 1:6-7 (ESV)
In this you **rejoice**, though now for a little while, <br/>
if necessary, you have been **grieved** by various **trials**,

so that the **tested genuineness** of your **faith** -- <br/>
more precious than **gold** <br/>
that perishes though it is **tested by fire** --

may be found to result in **praise** and glory and honor <br/>
at the **revelation** of Jesus Christ.

>>>
+ *tested genuineness*: δοκίμιον
  + testing of your faith
+ result in **praise** when Christ appears
