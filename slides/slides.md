# Faith that Stands the Test
## James 1:2-12

<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
# Will my **faith** stand the **test**?

---
## James 1:2-4 (NIV) (p.1/5)
2 Consider it **pure joy**, my brothers and sisters, <br/>
whenever you face **trials** of many kinds, <br/>
because you know that the <br/>
**testing** of your faith produces **perseverance**.

Let perseverance **finish** its work <br/>
so that you may be **mature** and **complete**, <br/>
not **lacking** anything.

---
## James 1:5-6 (NIV) (p.2/5)
5 If any of you lacks **wisdom**, <br/>
you should **ask God**, who gives **generously** <br/>
to all without finding fault, <br/>
and it will be **given** to you.

But when you ask, <br/>
you must **believe** and not doubt,

---
## James 1:6-8 (NIV) (p.3/5)
because the one who **doubts** <br/>
is like a **wave** of the sea, <br/>
**blown** and **tossed** by the wind.

7 That person should not expect <br/>
to receive anything from the Lord. <br/>
Such a person is **double-minded** <br/>
and **unstable** in all they do.

---
## James 1:9-10 (NIV) (p.4/5)
9 Believers in **humble** circumstances <br/>
ought to take **pride** in their **high** position.

But the **rich** should take pride <br/>
in their **humiliation** â€”  <br/>
since they will pass away like a **wild flower**.

For the sun rises with **scorching heat** <br/>
and **withers** the plant; <br/>
its **blossom** falls and its **beauty** is destroyed.

---
## James 1:11-12 (NIV) (p.5/5)
11 In the same way, the rich will **fade away** <br/>
even while they go about their **business**.

12 Blessed is the one who **perseveres under trial** <br/>
because, having stood the test,

that person will receive the **crown of life** <br/>
that the Lord has **promised** <br/>
to those who **love him**.
