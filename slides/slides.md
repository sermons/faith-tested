# Faith that <br/> Stands the Test
## James 1:2-12

<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
# What does it mean to have **faith** in Jesus?

---
## James 1:2-4 (NIV) (p.1/6)
<span class="hl2">2</span>
Consider it **pure joy**, my brothers and sisters, <br/>
whenever you face **trials** of many kinds, <br/>
<span class="hl2">3</span>
because you know that the <br/>
**testing** of your faith produces **perseverance**.

<span class="hl2">4</span>
Let perseverance **finish** its work <br/>
so that you may be **mature** and **complete**, <br/>
not **lacking** anything.

---
## James 1:5-6 (NIV) (p.2/6)
<span class="hl2">5</span>
If any of you lacks **wisdom**, <br/>
you should **ask God**, who gives **generously** <br/>
to all without finding fault, <br/>
and it will be **given** to you.

<span class="hl2">6</span>
But when you ask, <br/>
you must **believe** and not doubt,

---
## James 1:6-8 (NIV) (p.3/6)
because the one who **doubts** <br/>
is like a **wave** of the sea, <br/>
**blown** and **tossed** by the wind.

<span class="hl2">7</span>
That person should not expect <br/>
to receive anything from the Lord. <br/>
<span class="hl2">8</span>
Such a person is **double-minded** <br/>
and **unstable** in all they do.

---
## James 1:9-10 (NIV) (p.4/6)
<span class="hl2">9</span>
Believers in **humble** circumstances <br/>
ought to take **pride** in their **high** position.

<span class="hl2">10</span>
But the **rich** should take pride <br/>
in their **humiliation** —  <br/>
since they will pass away like a **wild flower**.

---
## James 1:11 (NIV) (p.5/6)
<span class="hl2">11</span>
For the sun rises with **scorching heat** <br/>
and **withers** the plant; <br/>
its **blossom** falls <br/>
and its **beauty** is destroyed.

In the same way, the rich will **fade away** <br/>
even while they go about their **business**.

---
## James 1:12 (NIV) (p.6/6)
<span class="hl2">12</span>
Blessed is the one <br/>
who **perseveres** under trial <br/>
because, having **stood the test**,

that person will receive the **crown of life** <br/>
that the Lord has promised <br/>
to those who **love him**.

## 1 Peter 1:6-7 (ESV)
In this you **rejoice**, though now for a little while, <br/>
if necessary, you have been **grieved** by various **trials**,

so that the **tested genuineness** of your **faith** -- <br/>

may be found to result in **praise** and glory and honor <br/>
at the **revelation** of Jesus Christ.
