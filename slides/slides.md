# What does it mean <br/> to have **faith** <br/> in Jesus?

---
[2](# "ref")
Consider it **pure joy**, my brothers and sisters, <br/>
whenever you face **trials** of many kinds, <br/>
[3](# "ref")
because you know that the <br/>
**testing** of your faith produces **perseverance**.

[4](# "ref")
Let perseverance **finish** its work <br/>
so that you may be **mature** and **complete**, <br/>
not **lacking** anything.

[James 1:2-4 (NIV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

---
[5](# "ref")
If any of you lacks **wisdom**, <br/>
you should **ask God**, who gives **generously** <br/>
to all without finding fault, <br/>
and it will be **given** to you.

[6](# "ref")
But when you ask, <br/>
you must **believe** and not doubt,

[James 1:5-6 (NIV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

---
because the one who **doubts** <br/>
is like a **wave** of the sea, <br/>
**blown** and **tossed** by the wind.

[7](# "ref")
That person should not expect <br/>
to receive anything from the Lord. <br/>
[8](# "ref")
Such a person is **double-minded** <br/>
and **unstable** in all they do.

[James 1:6-8 (NIV) (p.3/6)](# "ref")

---
[9](# "ref")
Believers in **humble** circumstances <br/>
ought to take **pride** in their **high** position.

[10](# "ref")
But the **rich** should take pride <br/>
in their **humiliation** —  <br/>
since they will pass away like a **wild flower**.

[James 1:9-10 (NIV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

---
[11](# "ref")
For the sun rises with **scorching heat** <br/>
and **withers** the plant; <br/>
its **blossom** falls <br/>
and its **beauty** is destroyed.

In the same way, the rich will **fade away** <br/>
even while they go about their **business**.

[James 1:11 (NIV) (p.5/6)](# "ref")

---
[12](# "ref")
Blessed is the one <br/>
who **perseveres** under trial <br/>
because, having **stood the test**,

that person will receive the **crown of life** <br/>
that the Lord has promised <br/>
to those who **love him**.
